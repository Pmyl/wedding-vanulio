    In Nottingham you&apos;ll find a lot of places where to stay during your holidays.
    There are a bunch of hotels in the city centre (<x id="START_LINK" ctype="x-a" equiv-text="&lt;a&gt;"/>booking.com<x id="CLOSE_LINK" ctype="x-a" equiv-text="&lt;/a&gt;"/>) with a good price range.
    For example Jury’s Inn is close to the station and 10 minute walk from the main square;
    Ibis hotel is right in the city centre, just in front of the tram station... you got the gist of it!!
    If you are looking for a flat for you and your family in the city you can find some places on
    websites like <x id="START_LINK_1" ctype="x-a" equiv-text="&lt;a&gt;"/>Airbnb.it<x id="CLOSE_LINK" ctype="x-a" equiv-text="&lt;/a&gt;"/><x id="START_TAG_SPAN" ctype="x-span" equiv-text="&lt;span&gt;"/> or <x id="CLOSE_TAG_SPAN" ctype="x-span" equiv-text="&lt;/span&gt;"/>
    <x id="START_LINK_2" ctype="x-a" equiv-text="&lt;a&gt;"/>hometogo.com<x id="CLOSE_LINK" ctype="x-a" equiv-text="&lt;/a&gt;"/>.
    <x id="START_TAG_STRONG" ctype="x-strong" equiv-text="&lt;strong&gt;"/>Some advice: <x id="CLOSE_TAG_STRONG" ctype="x-strong" equiv-text="&lt;/strong&gt;"/><x id="START_TAG_SPAN" ctype="x-span" equiv-text="&lt;span&gt;"/>try to book in the city centre (NG1) because if you are getting further then NG3
    you’ll be pretty far from the center and then you’ll need a bus or a cab to reach the main tourist
    sites. Also the city it’s quite beautiful and I think you don’t want to miss it!! Right in the city
    center you can find the gorgeous Old Market Square with its Neoclassical Council House, crowned
    by an imposing dome. 5 minutes away on foot you can reach the stunning Nottingham Castle: you must take
    a photo in front of the bronze statue of Robin Hood! The Castle affords excellent views of the town, two
    great museum and 100-meters long cave called Mortimer&apos;s Hole (the extravagant museum guide will show you all the history
    behind this venue). Not so far there is the popular Galleries of Justice Museum in the city&apos;s
    former court and jailhouse. And if you want to relax, if you are lucky enough to enjoy a sunny day,
    you can walk to the Arboretum, home to lovely gardens and some of the city&apos;s most popular festivals!
    If you are willing to take a bus you have to visit Highfields Park (which is part of the University Campus) and
    Wollaton Hall (a 200-hectare deer park). Also don&apos;t forget Sherwood Forest! I mean, these are the first things
    that come to my mind, there is so much more to do. Do you really want to miss a super greasy delicious burger at
    <x id="START_LINK_3" ctype="x-a" equiv-text="&lt;a&gt;"/>Annie&apos;s Burger Shack<x id="CLOSE_LINK" ctype="x-a" equiv-text="&lt;/a&gt;"/>?<x id="CLOSE_TAG_SPAN" ctype="x-span" equiv-text="&lt;/span&gt;"/>

      We don’t have a proper registry mainly because we don’t have a lot of space and we don’t
      lack home supplies! If you are willing to gift us anything we’ll let you know that we are planning a crazy honeymoon in Japan. It’s our dream holiday and we’ll be really grateful if
      you would contribute to make it an even more unique experience.
