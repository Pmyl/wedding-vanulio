      <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://thegallery.brewhouseandkitchen.com/">The Riverside Gallery</a> is located in an English style pub
      right on the River Trent. The place is surrounded by
      beautiful gardens and the majestic bridge on the river.<br />From the city center, the venue is very easy to reach:
      you can plan ahead and decide for a nice walk from your place
      it’s a 15 minute walk from Jury’s Inn or 25 minute walk from Old Market Square (the main
      square).
      But if your shoes are not comfy enought
      for a small walk you can grab a bus from almost everywhere.
      The venue it’s in a strategic place, we’ve thought of everything!!
      <br />
      ...if you are lazy like me and you want to go for a taxi
      I’m not here to judge you.
      <br />
      <br />
      By the way if you are planning to get there by car remember
      to check it in inside the pub: you’ll need to insert your plate number in their device and there you have it!

        The closest airport to Nottingham is East Midlands Airport
        and you can flight from Pisa on Wednesday and Sunday with Ryanair. The shortest trip
        would be coming here on the 30th of August and go back home on the 2nd of September.
        Then you can take a bus from the airport
        and in 45 minutes you'll be in the city centre (<a class="link" href="https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/services/skylinknottingham" target="_blank">bus Skylink</a>).
        There are different options for your ticket like single, double or family,
        pay attention so you’ll not miss a friendly discount.
        On average the prices are around £5 pp, if you don't book it in advance through the Ryanair website
        <i>be sure to have some change with you.</i>
        <br />If you are looking to share a ride with
        someone will be favourable to take an <a class="link" href="https://www.uber.com/gb/en/drive/" target="_blank">Uber</a> or call for a taxi from the airport
        desk (you'll see the indication when you land, don't worry).
        The prices are around 20/30£ per ride to the
        city centre and it will take less then 30 minutes.

      <p class="accommodation-london-route-details" i18n="@@londonRouteDescription">
        You can flight to London almost every day of the week from
        Pisa/Bologna but you can also look for some direct flight from
        Florence. Then, you can choose to stay for some days in the
        Capital and enjoy or go and reach Nottingham. You can take a <a class="link" href="https://www.nationalexpress.com/en" target="_blank">bus with National Express</a>
        (4 hours ride for £25pp) or a <a class="link" href="https://www.thetrainline.com" target="_blank">train with Trainline</a> (2 hours
        ride for £65 pp). Try to book in advance from their website just
        to be sound and safe. When you grab the bus/train you'll reach
        the city centre with no fuss. Be sure to carry with you a nice book or music.

    In Nottingham you'll find a lot of places where to stay during your holidays.
    There are a bunch of hotels in the city centre (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.booking.com">booking.com</a>) with a good price range.
    For example Jury’s Inn is close to the station and 10 minute walk from the main square;
    Ibis hotel is right in the city centre, just in front of the tram station... you got the gist of it!!
    If you are looking for a flat for you and your family in the city you can find some places on
    websites like <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.airbnb.it/">Airbnb.it</a><span> or </span>
    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.hometogo.com/">hometogo.com</a>.
    <strong>Some advice: </strong><span>try to book in the city centre (NG1) because if you are getting further then NG3
    you’ll be pretty far from the center and then you’ll need a bus or a cab to reach the main tourist
    sites. Also the city it’s quite beautiful and I think you don’t want to miss it!! Right in the city
    center you can find the gorgeous Old Market Square with its Neoclassical Council House, crowned
    by an imposing dome. 5 minutes away on foot you can reach the stunning Nottingham Castle: you must take
    a photo in front of the bronze statue of Robin Hood! The Castle affords excellent views of the town, two
    great museum and 100-meters long cave called Mortimer's Hole (the extravagant museum guide will show you all the history
    behind this venue). Not so far there is the popular Galleries of Justice Museum in the city's
    former court and jailhouse. And if you want to relax, if you are lucky enough to enjoy a sunny day,
    you can walk to the Arboretum, home to lovely gardens and some of the city's most popular festivals!
    If you are willing to take a bus you have to visit Highfields Park (which is part of the University Campus) and
    Wollaton Hall (a 200-hectare deer park). Also don't forget Sherwood Forest! I mean, these are the first things
    that come to my mind, there is so much more to do. Do you really want to miss a super greasy delicious burger at
